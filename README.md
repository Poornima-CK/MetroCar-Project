**Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project**

**Overview**

This repository contains the assessment of project for the Data Analysis Bootcamp Program at MasterSchool. 
The project aimed to analyse the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app similar to Uber/Lyft, using SQL for data querying and Plotly for data visualization.

**Project Background**

The project focused on conducting a comprehensive funnel analysis to identify areas for improvement. 
It aimed to address specific business questions, providing insights for optimization and recommendations based on data-driven findings.

**About Metrocar’s User Funnel**

Metrocar's business model is based on a platform that connects riders with drivers through a mobile application. 
Metrocar acts as an intermediary between riders and drivers, providing a user-friendly platform to connect them and facilitate the ride-hailing process
The customer funnel includes stages such as app download, signup, ride request, ride completed   and review. 
Drop-offs at each stage are analysed to identify optimization opportunities.

**About Metrocar’s Ride Funnel**

The ride funnel starts when the ride is requested and includes stages such as ride requested, ride accepted, ride completed, payment approved and review. 

**Business Questions**

The analysis addressed the following key business questions:

Optimizing the Funnel Stages

Platform-Based Marketing Insights

Analysis by Age Group

Surge Pricing Strategy

Lowest Conversion Rate Identification


**Recommendation**

The analysis has identified that the vast majority of the users have an iOS device and fall into the age group between 35 and 44 years old.

Users with the "Payment Declined" state should be addressed

Company needs to balance demand during peak hours (8 to 10 am and 4 to 6 pm)

Update to latest navigation systems to avoid longer routes

Provide necessary trainings to address rude behaviour and unprofessionalism

Conduct daily vehicle inspections and record keeping 

Driver information should be updated in the cases where they are not accepting the requests despite being available

**Additional Insights**

During the analysis, I have also identified that understanding customer opinions is crucial for effective service enhancement, 
and this analysis will help in making better decisions. 
I have tried to gain an understanding of the customer reviews by assessing the ratings and identify the most common adjectives and noun used in the reviews.  
From this extra analysis I have been able to identify things that may slow down the company growth. 
There are some challenges with drivers which concerns disrespectful and unprofessionalism, taking long routes, late arrival and rude driver interactions
For this reason, an in-depth sentiment analysis will definitely help to take better decision in the future and allocate the budget even more efficiently.
